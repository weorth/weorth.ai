qa.title|Frequently Asked Questions
qa.q1|How will artificial intelligence change the future?
qa.a1|The impact of artificial intelligence will be greater and will happen sooner than we can prepare for. It will likely change or disrupt just about everything we experience in our lives and in society as a whole.
qa.q2|Why do we need artificial intelligence?
qa.a2|The basic premise of AI is that it allows computer programs to learn, rather than needing to be specifically programmed to perform certain tasks. Because of AI, computers can now learn to do huge amounts of tasks and activities that used to require human intelligence. The more data the AI has, the better results it can produce.
qa.q3|How can we apply artificial intelligence?
qa.a3|As with the other technologies of the third industrial revolution, you don’t need to be an AI developer, or work in the industry, to want to learn about AI. Every one of us should be thinking about how we can apply AI in the different areas of our personal and professional lives.
qa.q4|What are some common benefits of artificial intelligence technology?
qa.a4|As AI will impact so many areas of our lives and businesses, there are actually enormous amounts of direct and indirect benefits that can be brought about thanks to artificial intelligence.
qa.q5|What are the current capabilities of artificial intelligence?
qa.a5|Google Duplex can make phone calls to make restaurant and hair appointments. Google Deep Mind won a global Starcraft game challenge against gaming pros. Amazon uses AI for book and product recommendations. Websites are using Chat-bots to answer basic customer queries. Airports are using image recognition for staff security. Rolls Royce is using AI for predictive maintenance and servicing of airplane engines. Informatica is using AI for compliance and data gathering and analysis purposes. Fintech is using AI to combine and analyse more diverse datasets. In Healthcare AI can help analyse more data for preventative medicine. Baidu in China is producing self driving buses for large cities.
qa.q6|What is the future of artificial intelligence?
qa.a6|Automated transport, taking over dangerous jobs, robots working with humans, improved elderly care, cyborg (organic/bio-mechanic) organisms, environment monitoring and response for climate change goals.
